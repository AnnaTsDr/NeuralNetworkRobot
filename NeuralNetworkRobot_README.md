# Neural Network Robot

This project demonstrates a robot programmed to simulate Pavlov's reflex using a basic neural network.

## Features
- Implementation of a simple neural network model with adjustable weights.
- Real-time motor control based on sensor inputs.
- Feedback loop for adaptive learning.

## How to Run
1. Compile the code using an ARM Cortex-M3 compatible compiler (e.g., Keil uVision).
2. Upload the binary to an LPC17xx microcontroller.
3. Connect the required hardware components (motors, sensors, LEDs, etc.).
4. Run the program and observe the robot's behavior based on neural network learning.

## Technologies
- Language: C
- Platform: LPC17xx Microcontroller
- Protocols: UART for communication
